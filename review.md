WWDC is just around the corner, and we're all excited to see what Apple has in store this year. As always, there are plenty of things we expect to see, and there are always a few surprises mixed in there as well. Here are a few specific additions I'd love to see come to Apple's biggets platforms this year.

## iOS

Live activities were one of the headline features of iOS 16 last year, and they're a very good addition to iOS, but they're not perfect, and I think one change could make them more useful and more convenient for users.

In short, apps should be able to start live activities on their own. Currently, you need to open an app manually, and then the app can start a live activity for you. I understand that Apple likely did this to prevent apps from starting live activities without the user's consent, flooding their lock screen and dynamic island with junk, but nearly a year on, I think this was too protective of users, and we should be able to let apps that we choose start live activities on their own.

By all means, make this an elevated permission that requires the user to explicitly allow it (like the "always allow" option for location access), but I think it would be a great addition to iOS. For example, I could let Fantastical always start a live activity for my meetings throughout the day. Or I could let my Formula 1 app, Box Box, automatically start a live activity for all practice, qualifying, and race sessions, since I know I'll want to have those all the time.

Like all permissions, this should be easy to revoke so that users maintain control over their device, but I think it's reasonabnle to trust users to give apps they choose to use this ability.

## iPadOS

If the last year has taught us anything, it's that the idea of Stage Manager and actually living with Stage Manager are two separate things. Windowing on iPadOS is a great idea, but it's not quite there yet, and I think there are a couple things that could be improved to make it more useful.

The big change I would make is to remove the fixed sizes that iPad windows snap to. It's pretty clear this was meant as a way to make it easier for users to get started with windowing, but I think it's a bit too restrictive, and actually makes things counterintuitive for users. It's been almost a year of using it and to this day I'm never quite 100% sure what will happen when I resize a window. Will it stick to the size I want? Will it move to another spot on the screen when I let go of the corner? Will it hide the dock because it thinks there's not enough space? Will it hide the recent apps on the left of the screen?

That's too many questions to have when simply trying to resize or move a window on screen. In my opinon, this is an example of a feature being too clever for its own good; they've overengineered for simplicity and instead have created a new complexity.

By allowing apps to freely resize (as the same apps already do on Apple Silicon Macs), Apple will make their windowing solution more intuitive and less frustrating for users.

Besides, the current solution isn't exactly ensuring that the window layout remains clean and organized, so why are we insisting on adhering to an arbitrary grid system in the first place?

## watchOS

There are a couple things I'd love to see come to watchOS this year, and they all revolve around workouts.

The big update I'd love to see are improvements to workout notifications. Currently, the default behavior is to get notified whenever any of your friends completes a workout. I've muted these for everyone beside my wife, and I pray that everyone who follows me has muted me because I do at least 3 workouts per day, and they're just not that exciting. I walk my dog the same distance 2-3 times per day, and I count those as workouts, but no one needs to get alerted every time I get home with the dog.

My proposal is a smart notification system that's the new default, and will only send post-workout notifications to your friends if the workout was notable in some way. Maybe you set a new personal best or you worked out for more time than ever before. Heck, maybe you just did your first workout after a few weeks off and might like some props for getting back on it.

This would continue the social aspect of workout out, which can be very motivating, but it would help reduce the notification spam that is the norm today.

Also on the notification front, I appreciate the "do you want to end your workout?" notification that comes up a few minutes after I complete a workout and am just recovering on the couch, but it's annoying that the 5 minutes I spent collapsed on the couch counts towards my average pace for the run I just completed. Apple could make this better in two ways.

The first would be to let me end the workout and delete the last X minutes since it thinks I stopped actually working out. The other would be to end the workout like normal, but then let me go into the Fitness app on my iPhone a trim the workout time just like I can trim a video in the Photos app.

## macOS

One of the most interesting apps released in recent memory is [Rewind.ai](https://www.rewind.ai/), an app that records everything you do on your computer and lets you search through everything you've done in seconds. It can even record audio and transcribe what you say and hear. But given the cost and privacy concerns of a tool with this remarkable amount of access to your computing habits, I would suspect most people would not want to have a third party doing this, they'd rather have it built into the OS.

And of course, Apple already has Spotlight, which lets any Mac user find any file on their computer or any info from the web quickly (or not so quickly, your results may vary), so adding the ability to search for anything you've seen, heard, or said on your computer would be a natural extension of Spotlight.

macOS is often on of the more pedestrian parts of WWDC, as it really hasn't changed substantially in many years. Yes, it keeps with most iOS features that come to the iPhone and iPad, but it's been a long time since it got something that really elevates it beyond those platforms, and something like this would really turn heads.

## Expectations

WWDC is scheduled to kick off on June 5, and we expect to see tons of updates to all of Apple's platforms. As always, there will be some things we expected and some that we never saw coming. Here's hoping some of the above wishes come true, but we'll know for sure in just a few short months.
