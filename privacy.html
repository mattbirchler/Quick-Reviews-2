<h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
<p>Our app is designed with privacy in mind. We collect and transmit very limited data:</p>

    <li>When using Magic Mode, we only transmit movie titles to the Open Movie Database (OMDB) to retrieve movie
        metadata</li>

    <li>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information</li>
    <li>We do not use cookies or tracking technologies</li>
    <li>We do not store your search history on our servers</li>
</ul>
<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>All your app data is stored locally on your device. We do not maintain any servers that store your personal
    information or usage data.</p>
<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The only third-party service we use is the Open Movie Database (OMDB) API. When you enable Magic Mode:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Movie titles are sent to OMDB to retrieve movie information</li>
    <li>This transmission is done securely</li>
    <li>No personal information is included in these requests</li>
</ul>
